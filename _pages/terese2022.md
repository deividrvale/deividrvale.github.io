The Term Rewriting Seminar (TeReSe) 2022 is an event by the Dutch (and nearby)
term rewriting community.
This typically takes the form of an afternoon with presentations from each of the represented universities,
with room for discussions during a joined dinner.

This year's seminar will be in honor of Hans Zantema, and it will be held in Nijmegen.
The event will take place as a hybrid event (zoom link will be made available shortly).
