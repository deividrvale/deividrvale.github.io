Welcome to my personal page.
Please, sit tight, grab a cup of coffee (or tea, if you may),
and enjoy your stay.

I am a post-doc at the Department of Sofware Science, Radboud University Nijmegen,
working under the
NWO [CHORPE](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~cynthiakop/chorpe.html) project.

## Research Interest

My research interests lie mainly in the intersection of
Computer Science, Logic, and Mathematics.
I am somewhat involved or reading a lot about the following topics:

* Higher-order rewriting
* Implicit complexity
* Nominal Techniques
* Structural Complexity
* Type-2 complexity
* Type-theoretical approach to complexity analysis
* Foundations of functional programming
* Formalization of mathematical structures (like rewriting) in Coq

## Main Research Projects

At the moment, I am working on three main research topics,
which I shall briefly present (in somewhat chronological order) below.

I started investigating nominal equational syntax and semantics
as my master thesis research project (you can find it on the publications page).
Mainly, I am concerned with reasoning about the syntax and semantics of
solving negated equations inside the nominal techniques.
<!-- TODO: Add a link to a project page for this project. -->
This (ongoing) project have been producing interesting results and collaborations over the years.

My principal research inquiry, which is the main topic of my Ph.D., focuses on complexity analysis and higher-order rewriting.
A term rewriting system is a model of computation where computations are modeled as a step-by-step transformation on objects.
In this context, studying complexity theory basically means measuring how many steps are needed to perform some task.
<!-- TODO: Write a blog post about rewriting as a model of computation. -->

More recently, I have been involved in a project to apply rewriting techniques to the field of Type-2 Structural Complexity Theory.
It is very new, so more updates will follow in the coming months.
